Execute a function with arguments given by `args` on `workers`.

This is merely a nice shortcut for `Distributed.pmap` running over a
`Distributed.CachingPool` of the given workers.

"""
$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Execute a function arguments from arrays `args` on `workers`, with a pre-cached
JuMP optimization model created from `constraints`, `objective` and `optimizer`
using [`optimization_model`](@ref). `settings` are applied to the optimization
model before first execution of `f`.

Since the model is cached and never re-created, this may be faster than just
plain [`screen`](@ref) in many use cases.

The function `f` is supposed to take `length(args)+1` arguments, the first
argument is the JuMP model, and the other arguments are taken from `args` as
with `Distributed.pmap`. While the model may be modified in place, one should
take care to avoid modifications that change results of subsequent invocations
of `f`, as that almost always results in data races and irreproducible
executions. Ideally, all modifications of the model should be either manually
reverted in the invocation of `f`, or the future invocations of `f` must be
able to overwrite them.

`f` may use [`optimized_model`](@ref) to extract results easily w.r.t. some
given `ConstraintTree`.

Make an JuMP model out of `constraints` using [`optimization_model`](@ref)
(most arguments are forwarded there), then apply the `settings`, optimize
the model, and return either `nothing` if the optimization failed, or `output`
substituted with the solved values (`output` defaults to `constraints`.

For a "nice" version for simpler finding of metabolic model optima, use
[`flux_balance_analysis`](@ref).

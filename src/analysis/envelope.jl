$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Optimize the system given by `constraints` and `objective` with `optimizer`
(with custom `settings`) for all combination of constriants given by `dims`.

`dims` should be compatible with pairs that assign a sequence of breaks to a
`ConstraintTrees.Value`: For example, `organism.fluxes.PFK => 1:3` will compute
optima of the model with the flux through `PFK` constrained to be equal to 1, 2
and 3.

In turn, all `dims` are converted to groups of equality constraints, and the
model is solved for all combinations. Shape of the output matrix corresponds to
`Iterators.product(last.(dims)...)`.

Operation is parallelized by distribution over `workers`; by default all
`Distributed.workers()` are used.

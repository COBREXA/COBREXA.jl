# Assumptions
1. Exchange reactions, *all* of which are idenitified in `exchange_reaction_ids`,
   have the form: `A[external] ⟷ ∅` where `A` is a metabolite. No other
   exchanges are allowed.
2. The biomass reaction of a model produces a biomass metabolite called
   `biomass_metabolite_id` with stoichiometry 1.
3. There is only one biomass reaction in the model.

3. The objective created by this model is the equal growth rate/balanced growth
   objective. In short, all biomass metabolites are produced at the same rate.

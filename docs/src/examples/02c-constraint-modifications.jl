# # Making adjustments to the constraint system
#
# In the [previous example about model
# adjustments](02b-model-modifications.md), we noted that some constraint
# systems may be to complex to be changed within the limits of the usual FBC
# model view, and we may require a sharper tool to do the changes we need. This
# example shows how to do that by modifying the constraint systems that are
# generated within COBREXA to represent the metabolic model contents.

# ## Changing the model-to-optimizer pipeline

# TODO clean up the stuff below:

# # Production envelopes
#
# Production envelopes determine the flux of the model objective at different
# values of specific reactions, spanning their variability. We can use the
# builtin function [`objective_production_envelope`](@ref) to quickly find such
# envelopes.

# We proceed as usual by loading the necessary models and packages:

using COBREXA

download_model(
    "http://bigg.ucsd.edu/static/models/e_coli_core.json",
    "e_coli_core.json",
    "7bedec10576cfe935b19218dc881f3fb14f890a1871448fc19a9b4ee15b448d8",
)

import JSONFBCModels
import GLPK

model = load_model("e_coli_core.json")

# The [`objective_production_envelope`](@ref) function finds the variability of
# the given reactons and returns a multidimensional matrix with exact number of
# `breaks` in each dimension (positioned in a linear lattice). Here we examine
# the inter-dependency of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchanges on a matrix of
# 5Ã—5 individual "conditions" that form the envelope:

envelope = objective_production_envelope(
    model,
    ["EX_o2_e", "EX_co2_e"];
    breaks = 5,
    optimizer = GLPK.Optimizer,
)

@test count(isnothing, envelope.objective_values) == 18 #src

# Documentation of the function describes ways to set custom bounds for the
# examined reaction flux ranges and several other customizations.

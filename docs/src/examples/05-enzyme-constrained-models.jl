using COBREXA

# model. We will need the model, which we can download if it is not already present.

# Enzyme constrained models require parameters that are usually not used by
# conventional constraint based models. These include reaction specific turnover
# numbers, molar masses of enzymes, and capacity bounds.

# ## Reaction turnover numbers

# Enzyme constrained models require reaction turnover numbers, which are often
# isozyme specfic. Many machine learning tools, or experimental data sets, can
# be used to estimate these parameters.

# We have the molar masses here:

ecoli_core_gene_product_masses

#md # !!! warning "Molar mass units"
#md #    Take care with the units of the molar masses. In literature they are usually reported in Da or kDa (g/mol). However, as noted above, flux units are typically mmol/gDW/h. Since the enzyme kinetic equation is `v = k * e`, where `k` is the turnover number, it suggests that the enzyme variable will have units of mmol/gDW. The molar masses come into play when setting the capacity limitations, e.g. usually a sum over all enzymes weighted by their molar masses: `e * mm`. Thus, if your capacity limitation has units of g/gDW, then the molar masses must have units of g/mmol (= kDa).

# ## Capacity limitation

# The capacity limitation usually denotes an upper bound of protein available to
# the cell.

total_enzyme_capacity = 50.0 # mg of enzyme/gDW

# ## Running a basic enzyme constrained model

# With all the parameters specified, we can directly use the enzyme constrained
# convenience function to run enzyme constrained FBA in one shot:

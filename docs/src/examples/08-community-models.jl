# # Community FBA models

using COBREXA

# Here we will construct a community FBA model of two  *E. coli* "core" models
# that can interact by exchanging selected metabolites. To do this, we will need
# the model, which we can download if it is not already present.

import Downloads: download

!isfile("e_coli_core.json") &&
    download("http://bigg.ucsd.edu/static/models/e_coli_core.json", "e_coli_core.json")

# Additionally to COBREXA and the model format package, we will need a solver
# -- let's use GLPK here:

import JSONFBCModels
import GLPK
import ConstraintTrees as C

model = load_model("e_coli_core.json")

# Community models work by joining its members together through their exchange
# reactions, weighted by the abundance of each microbe. These exchange reactions
# are then linked to an environmental exchange. For more theoretical details,
# see "Gottstein, et al, 2016, Constraint-based stoichiometric modelling from
# single organisms to microbial communities, Journal of the Royal Society
# Interface".

# ## Building a community of two *E. coli*s

# Here we will construct a simple community of two interacting microbes. To do
# this, we need to import the models. We will represent the models only as
# constraint trees, because it is easier to build the model explicitly than
# rely on an opaque one-shot function.

ecoli1 = flux_balance_constraints(model, interface = :sbo)
ecoli2 = flux_balance_constraints(model, interface = :sbo)

# Since the models are usually used in a mono-culture context, the glucose input
# for each individual member is limited. We need to undo this limitation, and
# rather rely on the constrained environmental exchange reaction (and the bounds
# we set for it earlier).
ecoli1.fluxes.EX_glc__D_e.bound = C.Between(-1000.0, 1000.0)
ecoli2.fluxes.EX_glc__D_e.bound = C.Between(-1000.0, 1000.0)

# To make the community interesting, we can limit different reactions in both
# members to see how the  models cope together:
ecoli1.fluxes.CYTBD.bound = C.Between(-10.0, 10.0)
ecoli2.fluxes.ACALD.bound = C.Between(-5.0, 5.0)

# Because we created the trees with interfaces, we can connect them easily to
# form a new model with the interface. For simplicity, we use the
# interface-scaling functionality of [`interface_constraints`](@ref
# ConstraintTrees.interface_constraints) to bring in cFBA-like community member
# abundances:

cc = interface_constraints(
    :bug1 => (ecoli1, ecoli1.interface, 0.2),
    :bug2 => (ecoli2, ecoli2.interface, 0.8),
)

# To make the community behave as expected, we need to force equal (scaled)
# growth of all members:

cc *=
    :equal_growth^equal_value_constraint(
        cc.bug1.fluxes.BIOMASS_Ecoli_core_w_GAM,
        cc.bug2.fluxes.BIOMASS_Ecoli_core_w_GAM,
    )

# Now we can simulate the community growth by optimizing the new "interfaced"
# biomass:

optimized_cc = optimized_values(
    cc,
    objective = cc.interface.biomass.BIOMASS_Ecoli_core_w_GAM.value,
    optimizer = GLPK.Optimizer,
)

# We can now e.g. observe the differences in individual pairs of exchanges:

C.zip(
    tuple,
    optimized_cc.bug1.interface.exchanges,
    optimized_cc.bug2.interface.exchanges,
    Tuple{Float64,Float64},
)
